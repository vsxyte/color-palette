<h1>design and development process</h1>
this project started with a simple idea to create a color selection interface. Initially I planned to create it in C++ with imgui, but the implementation of this idea came to naught

<h1>unique approaches</h1>
languages â€‹: HTML, JavaScript and CSS were used
the project uses the browser's localStorage API to persistently store saved color palettes, giving users easy access to their favorite color combinations between sessions.
Dynamic Palette Display: Palettes are dynamically generated and displayed in real time, offering users immediate visual feedback on color selection.


<h1>trade-offs and known issues:</h1>
The design certainly achieves its main goal of making color selection easier, but there are certain trade-offs and known problems that you should be aware of:

<h1>code quality.</h1> The codebase may not be of the best specifications.
limited functionality. Project, as a simple color picker, lacks the advanced features found in dedicated apps, such as advanced color manipulation or export options.

<h1>User interface/UX aspects.</h1>
While the user interface is functional, it lacks polish and sophistication, potentially resulting in a less intuitive user experience.

<h1>open file; running the code.</h1>
download the source code for html, and open it in any browser such as chrome, brave, and so on.

what about the second file? (souls.html)
This is an introductory project that I created a long time ago, but I think it will be fun to check it out.
